These be shot screens to accompany
https://www.kielipankki/.../case-freq-dist/.

The prefix "jcfd" stands for Java Chipster
Frequency Distributions. Quite mnemonic?  Then
"cqp" (CQP), "edu" (Eduskunta corpus), and
"pos" (pos, as in "part of speech") stand for
the stages of the narrative. And numbers stand
for the steps. The gaps in the numbers are,
like, just in case.

Original shots are in orig/. The shots in this
directory have additional paint to support the
narrative, such as it is.

The shots are full-window shots of a rather
tiny window. Possibly the window should have
been more realistic? But what would WordPress
have made of them then?

Because now it made tiny pictures that are
almost nearly somewhat readable as they are,
and can then point to full pictures. If it
would reduce a bigger picture to that tiny
(medium it call it) size, it would not be
readable as is.

Live and learn.
