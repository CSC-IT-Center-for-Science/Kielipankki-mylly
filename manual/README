These are manual pages for Mylly tools in HTML, to be copied manually
to an HTML editing box in the Kielipankki WordPress site. The template
(aptly named template.html) may be edited as experience accumulates.

Log in with HAKA* at https://www.kielipankki.fi/wp-admin when in a VPN
or something, select to edit pages, set parent page to support/manual,
copy the new page to the clipboard, see that the box is in text mode
(HTML is considered text), and paste. More or less. Details missing.

* Use the link "Login with Shibboleth" instead of the initial dialog.

$ hy-vpn start

[authentication dialog here]

[talk to the web site]

[arrange it to appear as support/manual/toolname/]

Add a new page, on the right-hand side of the browser window select
"manual" in the "Yl√§sivu" menu as the parent page. Edit the last part
of the "kestolinkki" on top of the window to be the tool name instead
of the generated identifier. It only allows to edit the last part.

[give it a title]

In the title box on top of the window, type the tool name in a human
way, to appear as the first part of the title of the page. (This
seemed to work nicely.)

[paste content it in the box]

$ xclip -selection clipboard -in demotokens.html

$ echo -n | xclip -selection clipboard

[or copy something harmless by way of a mouse, just to avoid
accidental pasting of a large clip elsewhere]

...

$ hy-vpn stop

It's possible to write the page in that box, but it's a tremendous
waste of time. Use a comfortable editor off-line, then copy and paste.

(The above notes assume a UHEL person on a Cubbli keyboard. Adapt.)
