These are notes on getting Mylly documentation to Language Bank pages.

Eventually each tool in Mylly should have an English manual page at
https://www.kielipankki.fi/support/mylly/tool-name/, Finnish at
https://www.kielipankki.fi/tuki/mylly/tool-name/.

Chipster "More help" button points to the English page, which should
point to the Finnish page, which should point to the English page.

* How to make a new manual page

There are English and Finnish template files for tools.
- template-en.html
- template-fi.html

Copy these over to names that match no fewer than four different
conventions: tool name, page language, src, and html. These are the
source files that need to be compiled to output files that protect the
HTML from being damaged by WordPress.
- tool-name.en.src.html
- tool-name.fi.src.html

(WordPress would insert spurious br-elements at ends of some lines.
The compilation step prevents this by inserting empty span-elements so
that the lines end inside an attribute value. For some reason this
makes WordPress give up.)

(Copy-paste will also break long lines. This may be a problem anyway.)

Touch the corresponding target files so that Makefile notices them.
- tool-name.en.out.html
- tool-name.fi.out.html

Edit the source. Then each source file will be newer than the target
file.

Make the output files. (The target file name can be specified as an
argument if the target file is not there. But the advice was to touch
it. Then it would be there.)

* How to edit a manual page

Edit the source.

Make the output file. (If a previous output file is not there, specify
it as a target. Or touch it before editing the source.)

* How to publish a manual page

Assume you have the necessary rights. Talk to Martin or Tero if not.

Establish a VPN connection to UHEL. WordPress login is restricted so.

$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@openvpn.service

Log in with HAKA at https://www.kielipankki.fi/wp-admin. (Use the link
"Login with Shibboleth" instead of the more prominent dialog.)

Select to *edit pages*:
- on the left, there are little pictures
- hover on the little picture that looks like stacked plain papers,
  and choose "Lisää uusi" (maybe - trying to figure it out again -
  incidentally, the little pictures do have text titles like "Sivut"
  in this case when there is room in the browser window)

Scroll down to select the *language* of the page.

Set *parent page* from "Yläsivu" in "Sivun ominaisuudet" on the right.
This will presumably set the eventual URL at support/mylly or
tuki/mylly.
- select "Support/Mylly user guide" if publishing an English page
- select "Tuki/Myllyn käyttöohjeet" if publishing a Finnish page

Add *Title* in the box on top where it says "Lisää otsikko tähän".
This may become the first part of HTML title element. Assume so?

The "permanent link" aka URL of the eventual page then appears below
that box, with the "last part" initially made from the given title but
editable. *Edit the last part* to match the tool name in Mylly; that
is how Mylly points to the English page.

See that the larger text box is in *text mode*. It accepts HTML then,
which it transforms in some ways (hence the protective compilation
step).

Copy the *output HTML page* to the *clipboard* with the following
command.

$ xclip -selection clipboard tool-name.en.out.html

Then *paste* the clipboard in the box. C-v will work. (Wonder whether
a "middle click" with -target text/html on xclip would work, but may
not want to activate the touchpad to do the middle click. Search web.)

To *update*, use C-a C-v in the box. No need to remove the previous
version.

$ xclip -selection clipboard /dev/null

It may be prudent to *preview* the page (a button "Esikatsele" in the
box "Julkaise" on the right, or "Esikatsele muutokset" after the page
is published).

*Publish* the page (the button "Julkaise" before publication, then
"Päivitä" after).

A bar of sorts appears with a link to *see the page* "Katso sivu".

To *log out*, hover on the "Tervehdys, Jussi Piitulainen" at top right
and select to log out "Kirjaudu ulos".

To instead continue adding pages, continue adding pages. There will be
a button to add another "Lisää uusi" even on top of the page. Repeat
the steps above.

* How to maintain a published page

To *find* the page in WordPress, go edit "Kaikki sivut" and *search*
for the name. English pages are under "support", Finnish pages "tuki".
Select "Muokkaa" or "Muokkaus" or whatever it is. Proceed as when the
page was first edited.

* Old notes follow

Nupdate: new naming convention and a Makefile to run nobr and sed

Nupdate: returned to documentation work around 2017-10-07 with a
general relation theory page ra.html, draft already public. The
WordPress survival kit consists of nobr.xsl to add harmless spans that
prevents the monster from adding unwanted br elements at ends of text
lines. Yes, in HTML. No, didn't expect anyone to believe it. - The
spans need post-processed, too, so do:

$ xsltproc nobr.xsl ra.html | sed $"s/nobr/\x0a/g" | xclip -selection clipboard

And then paste. Need to have a Makefile here eventually.

Old README follows as was/is.

These are manual pages for Mylly tools in HTML, to be copied manually
to an HTML editing box in the Kielipankki WordPress site. The template
(aptly named template.html) may be edited as experience accumulates.

Log in with HAKA* at https://www.kielipankki.fi/wp-admin when in a VPN
or something, select to edit pages, set parent page to support/manual,
copy the new page to the clipboard, see that the box is in text mode
(HTML is considered text), and paste. More or less. Details missing.

* Use the link "Login with Shibboleth" instead of the initial dialog.

$ hy-vpn start

[authentication dialog here]

[talk to the web site]

[arrange it to appear as support/manual/toolname/]

Add a new page, on the right-hand side of the browser window select
"manual" in the "Yläsivu" menu as the parent page. Edit the last part
of the "kestolinkki" on top of the window to be the tool name instead
of the generated identifier. It only allows to edit the last part.

[give it a title]

In the title box on top of the window, type the tool name in a human
way, to appear as the first part of the title of the page. (This
seemed to work nicely.)

[paste content it in the box]

$ xclip -selection clipboard -in demotokens.html

$ echo -n | xclip -selection clipboard

[or copy something harmless by way of a mouse, just to avoid
accidental pasting of a large clip elsewhere]

...

$ hy-vpn stop

It's possible to write the page in that box, but it's a tremendous
waste of time. Use a comfortable editor off-line, then copy and paste.

(The above notes assume a UHEL person on a Cubbli keyboard. Adapt.)
