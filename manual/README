These are manual pages for Mylly tools in HTML, to be copied manually
to an HTML editing box in the Kielipankki WordPress site. The template
(aptly named template.html) may be edited as experience accumulates.

Log in with HAKA at https://www.kielipankki.fi/wp-admin when in a VPN
or something, select to edit pages, set parent page to support/manual,
copy the new page to the clipboard, see that the box is in text mode
(HTML is considered text), and paste. More or less. Details missing.

$ hy-vpn start

[authentication dialog here]

[talk to the web site]

$ xclip -selection clipboard -in demotokens.html

[paste it in the box]

$ echo -n | xclip -selection clipboard

[or copy something harmless by way of a mouse]

[arrange for it to appear as support/manual/demotokens/]

...

$ hy-vpn stop

It's possible to write the page in that box, but it's a tremendous
waste of time. Use a comfortable editor off-line, then copy and paste.

(The above notes assume a UHEL person on a Cubbli keyboard. Adapt.)
