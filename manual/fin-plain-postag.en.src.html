  <h1>PoS-tag Finnish plaintext</h1>
  <p>The plaintext PoS-tagger divides input text
    into sentences and the sentences into tokens
    and annotates the tokens with an appropriate
    <em>lemma</em> (aka base form) and a
    <em>Part-of-Speech</em> tag (actually an
    elaborate code also known as
    <em>morpho-syntactic description</em>)
    which contains a simple PoS-tag.
