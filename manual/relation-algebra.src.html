  <h1>Relation algebra</h1>
  <p><em>This is a technical document about an implementation of
      relation algebra in Mylly. For practical examples, see (pages to
      be written).</em>
  </p>
  <p>This is work in progress. Added first examples 2017-10-07.
  </p>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>A <em>relation</em> is a set of <em>records</em> that assign
    definite values to a set of <em>attributes</em>. The attributes
    are names that constitute the type of the relation.
  </p>
  <p>In a fuller theory, the attributes also have their own types,
    but in Mylly, there is only an <em>intended</em> type for each
    attribute; formally all values are character strings. This
    limitation facilitates the representation of a relation as a
    simple text file in TSV format, with a headline of names and the
    corresponding values of each record on lines of their own,
    adjacent fields separated with tabs. (Link to the IANA RFC
    here.)
  </p>
  <p>Relations can contain an annotation structure attached to
    tokenized text (with unique identifiers within the relation), or
    metadata attached to sentence identifiers, or data frames that
    can be the input or output of a statistical analysis.
  </p>

      <th>sen</th>

  <p>A <em>relation algebra</em> consists of operations that make
    relations out of relations. There are also actions that produce
    relations but take another kind of input on the side, and tools
    that take relations but produce something else.
  </p>
  <p>Such tools can take apart and put together related relations in
    useful ways, opening up ways for further analysis. Some tools
    are generally applicable. In addition, Mylly provides more
    special tools to facilitate the manipulation and investigation
    of language data.
  </p>
  <h2>Unique and unordered attributes and records</h2>
  <p>Duplicate records are not allowed in a relation. The order of
    the lines in the TSV file that represents a relation does not
    matter: the record lines can be reordered arbitrarily or at
    will, and the file will still represent the same relation. A
    relation is literally a <em>set</em> of records.
  </p>
  <p>When multiplicity or order are important, the relation can
    contain attributes that make these explicit.
  </p>
  <p>The attributes are similarly distinct from each other and their
    order is the file that represents a relation is similarly
    accidental. The attributes, too, are literally a <em>set</em>.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>pos</th><th>lemma</th></tr>
    <tr><td>V  </td><td>olla </td></tr>
    <tr><td>V  </td><td>ei   </td></tr>
    <tr><td>V  </td><td>voida</td></tr>
  </table>
  <table>
    <tr><th>lemma</th><th>pos</th></tr>
    <tr><td>ei   </td><td>V  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>olla </td><td>V  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>voida</td><td>V  </td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>The join</h2>
  <p>Two relations <em>share</em> the attributes that have the same
    name (and type, in fuller theory).
  </p>
  <p>The <em>join</em> of two relations consists of the records that
    have all the attributes that either relation has, the <em>shared
      attributes</em> have the same value in both relations, and the
    other values are taken from the record that has the non-shared
    attribute.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>word</th>
      <th>pos</th>
      <th>tok</th>
      <th>sen</th>
      <th>lemma</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>ei </td><td>V</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>ei  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>on </td><td>V</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>olla</td></tr>
    <tr><td>on </td><td>V</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>olla</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ole</td><td>V</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>olla</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>(When there are <em>no</em> shared attributes, the join is
    the <em>product</em> of the relations. When <em>all</em>
    attributes are shared, the join is the <em>intersection</em> of
    the relations. It makes no <em>sense</em> to join relations
    where the formally shared attributes have
    different <em>intended</em> types.)
  </p>
  <p>(Example is to join data and meta that share a sentence
    identifier.)
  </p>
  <h2>Renaming of attributes</h2>
  <p>One or more attributes of a relation can be <em>renamed</em>
    for any reason, for no reason, and particularly to control their
    participation in joins as shared attributes or not as shared
    attributes, whichever is appropriate.
  </p>
  <h2>The projections</h2>
  <p>(Project to or out of selected attributes. Mylly provides
    versions that count the selected combinations.)
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>lemma</th></tr>
    <tr><td>ei   </td></tr>
    <tr><td>niin </td></tr>
    <tr><td>olla </td></tr>
    <tr><td>se   </td></tr>
  </table>
  <table>
    <tr><th>lemma</th><th>count</th></tr>
    <tr><td>olla </td><td>3</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ei   </td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>niin </td><td>1</td></tr>
    <tr><td>se   </td><td>1</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>The classification of sentences into moods without the actual
    sentences can be obtained either by keeping the mood and the
    sentence number, or by dropping the Finnish and English sentences.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>mood </th><th>sen</th></tr>
    <tr><td>calm </td><td>4  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>calm </td><td>3  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>angry</td><td>5  </td></tr>
  </table>
  <h2>Variations on the join</h2>
  <p>(Matching records, and those that do not match. Compose and
    image, probably, because it should be easier to provide them
    than explain that an immediate use case was not at hand. (The
    latter two are not implemented at the time of this writing,
    which is 2017-10-06.)
  </p>
  <p>The composition of the annotated sentences with the mood
    classification is like the corresponding join except for the
    omission of the shared attribute.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>tok</th>
      <th>mood</th>
      <th>word</th>
      <th>lemma</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>calm </td><td>on  </td><td>olla</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>calm </td><td>se  </td><td>se  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>calm </td><td>niin</td><td>niin</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>angry</td><td>on  </td><td>olla</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>calm </td><td>ei  </td><td>ei  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>calm </td><td>ole </td><td>olla</td></tr>
  </table>
  <h2>Parts and partitions</h2>
  <p>(Sum, selection of a part by a combination of attribute values,
    partition on an attribute either to a specific combination and
    complement or all parts - within reason, because who would want
    to deal with more files than they can reasonably deal with, in a
    graphical user interface)
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>tok</th>
      <th>mood</th>
      <th>word</th>
      <th>lemma</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>calm </td><td>on  </td><td>olla</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>angry</td><td>on  </td><td>olla</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>calm </td><td>ole </td><td>olla</td></tr>
  </table>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>tok</th>
      <th>mood</th>
      <th>word</th>
      <th>lemma</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>calm </td><td>se  </td><td>se  </td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>calm </td><td>niin</td><td>niin</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>calm </td><td>ei  </td><td>ei  </td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>(Random part. Not to be misunderestimated. (Also a tool to
    sample observations, more difficult to classify but also nice to
    have.))
  </p>
  <p>(Union, intersection and difference. No complement.)
  </p>
  <h2>Functional extension</h2>
  <p>A number of tools extend each record with a value that can be
    computed based on the values in that record. Such operations may
    involve another source of information, which can be another
    relation but can also be anything whatsoever.
  </p>
  <p>(Examples are the key-value expander and the new, as of
    2017-10-06, frequency counter.)
  </p>
  <p>For example, the frequencies of the lemmas in the vocabulary
    relation as counted in the corpus relation.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>lemma</th><th>pos</th><th>freq</th></tr>
    <tr><td>ei   </td><td>V  </td><td>1   </td></tr>
    <tr><td>olla </td><td>V  </td><td>3   </td></tr>
    <tr><td>voida</td><td>V  </td><td>0   </td></tr>
  </table>
