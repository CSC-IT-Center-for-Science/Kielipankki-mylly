  <h1>Validate VRT document</h1>
  <p>Check a purported VRT document for various issues and
    produce a validation report.
  </p>
  <p>Parameters specify the level of detail of the report.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>level</dt>
    <dd>error, warning, or info (defaults to warning) —
      when set to error, only report errors; when set to
      info, also report issues that are not problems at
      all but may be good to know
    </dd>
    <dt>verbosity</dt>
    <dd>verbose or summary (defaults to verbose) — when
      verbose, report the line number of each occurrence
      of each kind of issue; when summary, report the
      counts of each kind of issue but the line number for
      only the first occurrence
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Suppose the following document is <em>meant</em> to
    be in the VRT format.
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;text license="not
    to make nay use of this data"&gt;
    &lt;sentence&gt;
    five
    years
    &lt;sentence&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>The document is full of problems: The first line
    starts with a "left angle bracket" (less-than sign)
    but is neither a tag nor a comment. The second and
    third line would be a valid start tag of a text
    element if they were on one line, but neither line is
    valid VRT on their own. The second start tag of a
    sentence element should be an end tag — or the actual
    error might be something else, like many lines missing
    at this point. And there is no end tag to the text
    element or to a sentence element.
  </p>
  <p>There is also an apparent spelling error ("nay" for
    "any") in the intended attribute value, and likely no
    legal basis to attempt to prohibit any use of the data
    (which looks quite trivial). The validator cannot
    address such issues.
  </p>
  <p>The validation report is laid out as the following
    kind of table where each row documents a detected type
    of issue, together with the line number of an
    instance. The actual problematic content is not shown
    in the report. (Previous attempts to show the content
    in the reports have made the reports overly verbose.
    Some kinds of problems may also make the content
    awkward to display.)
  </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>line</th>
      <th>kind</th>
      <th>level</th>
      <th>issue</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>form</td>
      <td>error</td>
      <td>malformed tag</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>form</td>
      <td>error</td>
      <td>malformed tag</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>data</td>
      <td>error</td>
      <td>bare angle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>nest</td>
      <td>error</td>
      <td>element already open: sentence</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>nest</td>
      <td>error</td>
      <td>element not closed: sentence</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The "bare angle" refers to the "right angle bracket"
    (greater-than sign) that should be encoded
    as <code>&amp;gt;</code> in content. The line looks
    like a content line to the validator because it does
    not start with a left angle bracket.
  </p>
  <p>In this report, the validator has not recognized the
    start tag of the text element, so it cannot detect
    that the corresponding end tag is missing.
  </p>
  <p>The line number 8, where missing end tags are
    reported, is one past the end of the document.
  </p>
  <p>An actual report may vary depending on the current
    version of the validator.
